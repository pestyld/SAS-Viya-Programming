## Description of Folders

### Ask the Expert CASL 2023
Getting started with the CAS language in SAS Viya ask the expert webinar.

### Ask the Expert Special Edition - Viya Programming 2022
[Getting to Know SAS® Viya®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/webinars/getting-to-know-sas-viya.html) Special Edition ask the expert webinar. This special edition Ask the Expert learning event will introduce you to SAS Viya.

You’ll learn what Viya is, its key attributes, how users in different roles interact with Viya, and how it provides support for the complete analytics life cycle, turning massive amounts of raw data into actionable insights.

The folder contains the code for my section on comparing the SAS compute server and the CAS server. How to convert your code to run in the distributed CAS environment.

### CASL Tips and Tricks
This repo includes a variety CASL code snippets to process data in the CAS server in SAS Viya. The CAS server is distributed server that uses multiple machines to perform massively parallel processing (MPP). 

- For more information about the CAS server visit the [SAS® Cloud Analytic Services: Fundamentals documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/v_032/casfun/titlepage.htm).

#### NOTE: Training and demo images were used to create the blogs and code snippets. Some demo passwords are included in the code since they are simple training environments. In a production environment you should never include your password in plain text. These are simple training images, so the passwords were used to show how to connect to the CAS server.
