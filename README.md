This repository contains a variety of SAS and CASL programs in SAS Viya. It also contains code snippets in how to use the Python editor in SAS Viya.

## Description of Workshops (each folders)

### [Ask the Expert CASL 2023](https://github.com/pestyld/SAS-Viya-Programming/tree/master/Ask%20the%20Expert%20CASL%202023)
In this webinar, we’ll cover the fundamentals of the SAS Viya platform and CAS, then dive into CASL, the scripting language designed to support the entire analytics life cycle.

### Ask the Expert Getting to Know SAS® Viya
This special edition Ask the Expert learning event will introduce you to SAS Viya.

You’ll learn what Viya is, its key attributes, how users in different roles interact with Viya, and how it provides support for the complete analytics life cycle, turning massive amounts of raw data into actionable insights.

### CAS Action Blog Series
Folder contains all programs for my [CAS Action! - a series](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2021/08/06/cas-action-a-series-on-fundamentals/) on fundamentals blog series.

### CASL Tips and Tricks
This repo includes a variety CASL code snippets to process data in the CAS server in SAS Viya. The CAS server is distributed server that uses multiple machines to perform massively parallel processing (MPP). 

- For more information about the CAS server visit the [SAS® Cloud Analytic Services: Fundamentals documentation](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/default/casfun/titlepage.htm).
- For more information about the CASL language visit the [SAS® Cloud Analytic Services: CASL Programmer’s Guide](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/default/caslpg/titlepage.htm)

### Create and Use CAS UDF
Learn how to create a User Defined Function (UDF) for the massively parallel processing CAS server.

### Current_Working_Directory

### cre8_fake_data
Series of SAS programs to create fake data of n size in the distributed CAS server.

#### NOTE: Training and demo images were used to create the blogs and code snippets. Some demo passwords are included in the code since they are simple training environments. In a production environment you should never include your password in plain text. These are simple training images, so the passwords were used to show how to connect to the CAS server.
